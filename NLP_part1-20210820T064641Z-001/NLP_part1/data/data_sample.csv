"Hitokiri (which translates roughly ""assassination""), a/k/a ""Tenchu"" translates roughly ""divine punishment"") showcases Hideo Gosha top form. miss one, Gosha's classic, Goyokin! Hitokiri one Gosha's best films, it's one best ""samurai/chambara"" films ever made, perhaps one best Japanese films ever exported.<br /><br />Be warned, intricate plot details Hitokiri little hard follow unfamiliar 19th century Japanese history. Even so, underlying human drama obvious open viewers. per norm Gosha, Hitokiri provides yet another variation traditional theme ""loyalty one's lord"" vs. ""doing right thing"". However, Gosha develops favorite theme sophistication, it's really _the_ movie see (along Goyokin, course).<br /><br />I suppose breaks like this: want simpler, action-oriented tale, might want see Goyokin. However, want thoughtful, multilayered (albeit grim) drama, see one.<br /><br />(OK, OK, essentially, historical backdrop massive power grap many different samurai clans either (1) working reform, yet retain, Tokugawa Shogunate, (2) trying install Emperor Meiji supreme ruler Japan. course, clans working ""for"" Emperor Meiji often less interested ""reforming"" Japan ensuring clan power ""new world order"". Ironically, entire feudal system officially abolished one first reforms Meiji government. It's ironic twists like -- Gosha's big irony -- make entire plot bittersweet.)<br /><br />What distinguishes ""Hitokiri"" Gosha's movies Gosha's mature sense cinematography. Every shot thoughtfully composed, (much like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon) frame movie could hold still composition. course, typical Gosha. Hitokiri really stands stunning backdrops, including(as Goyokin) many riveting seascapes. watch opening sequence, you're hooked! Make mistake, English period piece: Hitokiri extremely violent (don't say weren't warned).<br /><br />What else, cool camera work, makes Hitokiri stand out? performances seem (to me) bit subtle one. Katsu Shintaro (of Zatoichi/Hanzo Razor fame) turns star performance conflicted protagonist/antihero, Okada Izo. Katsu manages instill humanity character seems almost wild animal villain. Throughout movie, you're never quite sure you're engaged revolted Okada's character. time, Katsu's portrayal Okada's ravenous hunger respect, later pathetic attempts redemption, seem human can't help feel empathy/sympathy. course, seeing Nakadai Tatsuya play tortured hero ""Goyokin"", it's great see play ruthless villain ""Hitokiri"". He's perfect, there's nothing say!<br /><br />As final note, perhaps interesting buffs casual fans, don't miss last screen appearance Mishima Yukio (yes, closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist committed suicide seppuku crowd jeering Japanese military personnel ""kidnapped"" 1970, movie life work made Paul Schrader), actually pretty solid job portraying honorable (for assassin) Shinbei Tanaka.",1

Though hippie aspects tacky parts ""Blow Up"", created nice texture gave film meaning might otherwise had. cautionary mature little film.<br /><br />With ""Zabriskie Point"" Antonioni throws away ambiguities subtleties ""Blow Up"" goes full blown hippie. result film awash bad metaphors, stupid ideas heavy handed storytelling. could somebody, across career displayed restraint intelligence, make something silly? <br /><br />The film opens nice series close ups, watch group radicals discussing meaning revolution. Suddenly one man (Mark) gets leaves. hates rigid ordered nature revolution. recognises that, though revolutionaries fight freedom, bind oneself militant cause effectively give freedom away. like Jack Nicholson ""The Passenger"", Mark wants free.<br /><br />As such, Mark buys gun goes solo. takes orders one. police raid university campus Mark shoots guy runs away. flees nearby airfield, steals small private plane flies desert.

Soon, father son pursued Chicago fellow hit-man (a menacing Jude Law) waiting them.<br /><br />On face it, reads like pretty standard gangster film I've said, isn't really gangsters all. It's relationship father son thrown together tragic circumstances.

It's notorious Spanish first language. dozens good Latin actors could've performed Cardinal SebastiÃ¡n. Petrus Antonius (General RodrÃ­guez) also bad choice ""Latin Police officer"". funny seeing Elizondo Petronius General RodrÃ­guez's office. looked like two English American students Spanish class, making best effort order pronounce Spanish.

"Facts National Lampoon Goes Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon's Movie Madness:<br /><br />1. movie poor, even Lampoon's typical standards. 2. It's funny. 3. one goes see movie.<br /><br />So, finished watching it, began wondering earth it's called 'National Lampoon Goes Movies,' ever conceived, much less actually made. would like calling Austin Powers 'An American Guy Goes Movies.' lame. isn't American, doesn't go movies. None characters Lampoon's so-called 'satire' funny, none go see movies, causes bit problem. hoped would something vein Mystery Science Theater 3000, isn't.<br /><br />This National Lampoon's first film Animal House, although couldn't tell quality film. Poorly developed, rough amateurish standard, induces headaches Â? good sign 89-minute movie seems double length.<br /><br />I've noticed pattern. Really bad movies typically renamed Â? little disaster falls category. two separate titles -- probably help try promote people stupid remember bad panning received home video critics 1982/83. 'Hmm, Movie Madness Â? I've never heard movie before! Let's rent it!' then, realization: 'Hey, wait minute, National Lampoon Goes Movies!'<br /><br />It shelved MGM/UA, never released theaters DVD; occasionally pops television times per decade, place you'll manage find it.<br /><br />It's split three stories Â? parody self-enlargement videos, butter corporate ruthlessness, police brutality/cop-buddy films (I guess). first segment stars Peter Riegert (Animal House) frustrated guy divorces wife stuff. I'm sure boring mind started drift. sex scene popped up.<br /><br />Part II exotic dancer raped stick butter (don't ask) decides become Queen Margarine cut supply dairy products. Ouch! contains funny line movie: 'Only make love son!' think doesn't sound funny, you're right Â? it's not. imagine Â? it's highlight film!<br /><br />Part III cop chases serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) lose nerve shoot guy. contain one funny scene it's extremely over-acted Â? Lloyd really exhibits humor, playing character dry compassionate, yet strangely surreal. part he's choking victim meek cop stands watching unfold, least, evoked chuckle two.<br /><br />It's shame watch cast semi-famous names resort low standards. writers segment clearly believe they're ironic clever spoofing so-called stereotypes Â? fault movie becomes one huge contradiction, favoring standard & instead plot; crude humor instead witty dialogue; desperate performances instead inspired ones. It's easy see none actors enthralled material, muttering lines, often embarrassed seldom make eye contact camera.<br /><br />The movie isn't funny, said before. laughed once, one line, even halfhearted one. Two chuckles, smile, weak laugh. Compared Movie Madness, number decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.<br /><br />I like National Lampoon's Vacation series (or, least three four installments), classic Animal House, recent slew direct-to-video bombs Golf Punks (with great comic genius Tom Arnold) provide good example magazine went print decade ago. gets really old, really fast.<br /><br />Sad see new film, called Gold Diggers, released 'stamp approval.' It's like condemning film even hits theaters Â? maybe start advertising name placeÂ <br /><br />Distributor: 'This movie bad. gets National Lampoon stamp approval. That'll teach make something awful next time.'<br /><br />Forget death penalty. stick bunch criminals room make watch every day month.<br /><br />It's bad can't even begin explain putrid vileness. give up.",0

Unfortunately, happen here; extremely one-note Power greatly miscast boot. Fortunately, supporting cast quite good, Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson particularly so; then-famous performance Anne Baxter, however, worn well one would hope.<br /><br />With running time two half hours, film also feels unnecessarily long. seemingly endless cocktail party-type banter, indeed entire India sequence (which reads faintly hilarious) would better cut entirely--an odd situation, sequence intended crux entire film. Regardless specific scene, seems go actual point.<br /><br />As DVD itself, film remastered, print extremely good, bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither noticeably poor. said done, give RAZOR'S EDGE four stars production values everyone's willingness take material--but frankly, film best left Power Tierney fans, enjoy sake stars, whose ideas spiritual enlightenment vague film itself.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer",0

Director Franco Zerifferelli revels beautiful long shots snow falling winter sky, lonely Rochester standing rock, Jane looking window - less good telling story bringing characters life. addition, script merely scratches surface novel leaving many important scenes. consequence film show depth complexity relationship Jane Rochester, sadly also include humorous side intercourse. number short conversations Rochester Jane, beautifully staged, couple sentences exchange suffice show audience drawn other. know supposed fall love, never see actually happen. scene Rochester wants find Jane's reaction dilemma putting case hypothetical form wounded Mason left house completely missing, farewell scene, important scene - climax - novel reduced four sentences.

Gainsbourgh manages well let audience guess inner fire strong hidden behind stoic mask. unfortunately script never allows expand passionate lively side Jane's character further. result leaving many scenes shortening much dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal Jane must necessarily remain incomplete therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. pity, better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might good Jane Zelah Clarke '83 version.<br /><br />But still obvious Gainsbourgh trying play Jane, trace whatsoever Rochester character William Hurt portrays. Hurt, proved fine actor many good movies, must aware physically type-wise miscast even attempt playing Rochester novel. Rochester, besides blond blue-eyed, soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy quiet, slightly queer eccentric, basically good-natured mild. far irascible, moody grim lines referring traits character sound absolutely ridiculous.

Still, offends less Rochesters '70, '97 2006 versions would general rank Jane Eyre higher three ones. Hurt obviously wits recognise could Rochester novel therefore try so, whereas George C. Scott, CiarÃ n Hinds Toby Stephens thought could, failed miserably, I'd rather watch character Rochester Rochester badly played. I'd rather watch Jane Eyre movie leaves many lines novel invent new ones version uses modernised dialogues sound could uttered today's couple Starbucks cafÃ©. course Jane Eyre failure, least inoffensive one, one say '97 2006 adaptations. would therefore desist anyone watching adaptation: find Jane Eyre, least find beautifully made movie.",0

Movies bad, never made. good selection.<br /><br />Everything movie thoroughly horrible two exceptions, gore make-up (which showed potential) editing (which slightly rest movie, terms horrible). acting horrible around, dialog horrible, script, direction. It's good movie.<br /><br />It consists two forms special effects, gore stock footage space. I'll focus gore. Watching movie, thought myself, ""What motivation behind making movie?"" People like making stuff, sure, hesitant think anything good could come anyone involved. came conclusion movie made means increase Make-up Effects guy's Demo Reel. (Rick Baker) actually went pretty nice career, he's worked STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN BLACK (1996), even INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), plus number notable flicks. that, can't say I've ever actually SEEN real, live melting man - incredible, otherwise - I'd say seemed fair representation one.<br /><br />Now, think bad editing, usually think maybe scene someone's talking phone then, middle scene, phone jumps shoulder, something effect. movie really serves highlighted fact bad editing take many forms. Specifically, over-long utterly useless scenes. every scene dragged longer have, little bit dead air crazy-long screaming scene Cleaver Girl. severed head river, head gets thrown river (in slow motion), movie carries couple minutes, cut back floating head watch fall waterfall. I'm sure proud severed head, HELL??<br /><br />Lastly, I'll mention running fat lady/slow motion scene right near beginning. jerky slow motion tells didn't shoot scene slow motion originally later decided ""wasn't working like that"" slowed down.

There's things happen people, Kurosawa's challenge interweave cohesive whole. character starts picture, oddly enough (though thankfully there's much room grow), Rokkuchan, brain damaged man-child goes around day making train sounds (the 'clickety-clack' title), sometimes stopping pray mother. branch off: there's father son, latter scrounges restaurants food former goes site-specific descriptions dream house; older man look death him, learn later he's lost lot he'll tell people, including woman past him; shy, quiet woman works servitude adoptive father (or uncle, I'm sure), rapes her; meek guy suit constant facial tick big mean wife- social around.<br /><br />There also little markers people around characters, like two drunks keep stumbling around every night, like clockwork, putting big demands spouses, sometimes (unintentionally) swapping them! there's kind sake salesman bike sweet strange connection shy quiet woman. course there's group gossiping ladies squat around watering hole middle slum, anything nice say anyone unless it's something erotic guy.

Kurosawa allows actors room improvise, camera movements still remain they've always been- patient alert, wide compositions claustrophobic shots, painterly visions faces sometimes stylization silent drama meant weeper. Amid sometimes bizarre touching stories, (i.e. father son car) especially sad, Kurosawa lights film designs color scheme first one Eastmancolor like it's one paintings. Lush, sprawling, spilling times seams always control, place necessarily ""lighter""; it's like abstract come full-throttle scene, things look vibrant much darker underneath.

Someone steals high-tech stealth fighter, planning use fire chemical weapons (which later, bizarrely discover, destroy whole world 48 hrs). Seagal get plane back. It's simple, annoying sub-plots, conspiracies weighing film like far many recent works. That's suddenly say storytelling good though, it's pretty poor. introduction side characters badly done example.<br /><br />In filmic terms FOF bad. It's badly acted involved, Seagal looks bored tears almost.

Fan's though may argue, least owes effort. He's seriously looking jaded, continued use stand ins dub-overs indication this. Michael Keusch directs efficiency, cinematography quite good, technical areas (and usual Castel, bog standard stunt team) there's nothing mediocrity, nothing help film rise material, bored leading man. there's action scenes focusing characters Seagal, truth don't want see.<br /><br />Overall action isn't bad. It's nice violent, occasion we're treated vintage nasty Seagal beatings, overall nothing special. Partly due poor stunt crew, lack time film anything complex exciting. me, Shadow Man enjoyable film, ignoring incoherent, jumbled, plot line, vintage Seagal moments, centre stage. never disappeared long periods film. Seagal disappears bizarrely one action scene here, re-appears after, little explanation. There's far much stock footage used. Using stock shots isn't entirely horrendous thing, using crutch is. We're treated countless establishing shots naval ships, time, get annoying. Plus continuity stock footage place (just check backdrops, chopping changing).<br /><br />The film middle road. says films best scene completely needless, gratuitous girl girl scene, two hot chicks.

Jon Voight plays young man named Joe Buck Texas decides make big male hustler New York City escorting rich women. emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers wearing cowboy outfit thinking impress women. rejected women come across, meets sleazy con-man named Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo played Dustin Hoffman.

Without giving away much plot, want say remainder movie deals Joe Ratso try help one another attempt fulfill dreams. I.E. Joe making gigolo Ratso going Florida thinks regain health.<br /><br />I want make comments movie itself. First all, acting excellent, especially leads. Although movie really sad beginning end, classic scenes. fact, scenes intended funny, find amusing. example, classic scene Dustin Hoffman Jon Voight walking city street cab practically runs over. Dustin Hoffman bangs cab says ""Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!"" get kick scene typical New York City many people hurry. Another scene comes mind scene Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) guy named O'Daniel. amusing first, think O'Daniel recruit gigolos see Joe getting excited begin realize O'Daniel nothing religious nut. addition two scenes mentioned, love scene Ratso Joe arguing apartment Ratso says Joe cowboy outfit attracts homosexuals Joe says self-defense ""John Wayne! gonna tell he's fag!"" like delivery scene.<br /><br />I would say even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY set late '60's, much rings true today. That's although area around 42nd Street New York cleaned form Disneyfication last several years, homelessness still prevalent 40 years ago. Also, many people unrealistic dreams going strike big dreams smashed case Jon Voight character.

"times, overtakes Thing favourite horror film. Carpenter's film efficient entertaining flick, Kubrick's artistic, thought-provoking, probably scarier. It's one films look past flaws truly wholly love it. try compare book Â? I've read once, number years ago, scared death Â? two don't lot common, besides story characters obviously. It's almost Kubrick banking people's love novel order make film frightening. way, it's certainly one interesting book adaptations ever made, well one greatest horror films.<br /><br />What makes film terrifying jump scares, blood gore, various ghosts pop time time. It's destruction Jack Torrence. people complained casting Nicholson role, saying it's obvious he's going go crazy film, given past roles appearance. disagree. know he's going go crazy Â? since us read book Â? Jack's appearance furthers notion. it's way acts beginning makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. engages inane small talk hotel managers even family. wife son irritating his, it's small wonder manages so. gets Overlook, changes. becomes irritable, angry, edge. scene always shocks Wendy interrupts typing, utterly loses it, telling ""leave f*** alone"". first f-bomb dropped film, it's shock system. on, bets off.<br /><br />Another thing love multiple interpretations present film. We're never really sure we're seeing actually happening. Many critics noted whenever Jack talks ghost, there's mirror present, showing may well talking himself. characters? Wendy never sees anything film's climax, given tour hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, well aware something wrong, Danny connects place almost immediately. psychic powers question Â? else would Hallorann know come hotel?

Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, bizarre imagery contribute horror. use colour, mirrors, long hallways, every motif heightens this. don't even get started score. don't know film would half scary without haunting, electronic tune. strangeness perfectly reflects hotel, mood, entire film itself.<br /><br />I know King doesn't like film, King's input cinema nothing brag about. great novel writer may be, screenplays terrible, attempt directing better left unnoticed. faithful book adaptation, doesn't need be, really shouldn't. Part horror film viewer doesn't book fall back on; there's reassuring source material.

"Well, maybe PC version game impressive. Maybe. finished playing PS2 version it's pretty much complete mess.<br /><br />There couple elements okay promising. I'll mention first quickly. First, idea historical GTA-like game great one. game Gun historical GTA-like game unlike Mafia, Gun excellent. I'd love see game set Mafia's era done right. Next, storyline well written. story makes sense, dramatic arcs, uses unusual device (with much game backstory) it's interesting. Finally, graphics--especially used cutscenes--are impressive. Mafia's designers seemed focus getting graphics right places GTA skimped effort, especially characters. Unfortunately many areas, graphics kinda stink, I'd much rather excellent gameplay impressive-looking characters.<br /><br />The gameplay sinks title low. First off, controls camera absolutely suck. first focus game developers. can't release game controls and/or camera suck. Number one, there's reason player's character, Tom, can't full range motion controlled left analog stick. Unless it's absolutely necessary, hardly ever is, hate set-up left stick moves character ""strafing"" way character turn using right analog stick. Here, it's unnecessary, makes simplest actions challenge. example, Tom climb couple missions. game designed poorly frustratingly keep manipulating right analog stick camera, press L1 every time need climb, Tom descend instead.<br /><br />Next, I've never seen worse fighting system. first problem can't auto-aim lock targets. one early point, game seems tell use L2 R2 lock targets, never worked. focus enemy, struggle stupid right analog stick try keep adjusting character's orientation camera, tends drift wrong angle make Tom disappear time. time, you're probably getting pummeled shot death.<br /><br />Next, you're touching almost touching enemy--and that's certainly going case hand hand combat using melee weapons, fighting system--which primarily consists tapping holding R1, completely useless. Enemies pummel almost bear hug, can't move unless back off. close fighting tends consist yanking left analog stick, yelling character move away, won't 50% time, tapping R1 much enemy gets close makes R1 useless. enemy changes angle meantime, you're also going struggle right analog stick get character oriented right way get camera position see anything. time, you're probably getting pummeled shot again, option try move character away again. fights often consisted making Tom run circles around area like comedy film, hoping could gain enough time struggle analog stick get couple shots AI's mercy again. much realistic fighting.<br /><br />And problems exist trying fight guns. you're touching someone, half time controller won't allow fire shot, yet still riddle full holes. Additionally, there's auto-aim, aiming system ridiculously sensitive, even sensitivity set zero Options. Gunfights tend consist hopelessly trying aim move away enemy puts shot shot you. Luckily not, damage seems recorded almost randomly. take one ten shots incapacitate character, there's rhyme reason it. put five shots enemy's head near point blank range they'll still return fire hurt you. Yet, game designers seemed care enough realism built recoil aiming system, shots powerful enough guns, aim float target, you'll fight again.<br /><br />As celebrated graphics, except characters textures you're close to, they're actually pretty disappointing. distance always seems mostly empty, often expanses flat colors textures nearby you're driving. city wasn't well designed. It's varied enough, aren't many interesting things see do. cars seem slow they're difficult control. also drive same. mentioned music, also pretty nondescript. much better job could done end. Also, many others mentioned, load times ridiculous constant. tend minute long, occur middle everything--even races.<br /><br />Overall, Mafia port PS2, least, seems rushed. game feels plays like incomplete hack job.",0

It's it's bad movie, lame plot overall strangeness extremely unpleasant, seems filmmakers either mentally retarded (which possible explanation movie sucks like does, though probably still sucks even compared films made retards) deliberately made every illogical decision make movie suck much possible. example, see Donald Sutherland running around huge, fat ugly mole face. normally mole. mole add character. extremely ugly distracting.

Five minutes later, ""three weeks later"" appears screen, sudden we've got different actor playing older Ned. What, think we're idiots? Good God!

"""Fever Pitch"" isn't bad film; it's terrible film.<br /><br />Is possible American movie audiences critics numbed lobotomized excrement Hollywood churns they'll praise skies even mediocre film barely laughs? That's reason think horrible romantic comedy (and use term loosely there's nothing funny film) getting good reviews.<br /><br />I sat film stunned screenwriters Lowell Ganz Babaloo Mandel would even instant think script funny.<br /><br />The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well film. adapted ""Fever Pitch"" British film starring Colin Firth Ruth Gemmell 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice ""About Boy"" (2002) ""High Fidelity"" Americanized movie 2000, writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack Scott Rosenberg didn't go wrong kept essence Hornby's wit humor. made one best films year.<br /><br />So American version ""Fever Pitch"" go painfully awry? British version wasn't masterpiece, charming, funny, unexpected gave us two characters could like, respect understand.<br /><br />But Ganz Mandel excised everything funny Hornby's work. Americanizing story, they've butchered it, removing good unique Hornby's work replacing conventional drivel.<br /><br />They've transformed funny story formulaic romantic comedy, never veering wretched formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) three girlfriends, distinct function. One's overweight, second's cynical ambitious, third's romantic. Want guess many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has?<br /><br />What made ""High Fidelity"" fun good leading man lady, engaging supporting characters. ""Fever Pitch,"" six supporting friends say nothing especially funny. They're insignificant, they're even decorative. reason they're film formula demands it. Poor Ione Skye winds one Lindsey's pals thankless role. lovely Skye must wishing Lloyd Dobler would swoop take away. Come think it, Cusack would've made excellent Ben. course, Cusack smart attach utterly tedious script.<br /><br />There isn't single, solitary moment film seems original unforced. Every plot turn predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. Ganz Mandel labor laughs. first 45 minutes excruciatingly slow, wonder chaps realized writing comedy. mark plot turns film watch. It's almost Ganz Mandel penned screen writing guru's formula pasted wall. got certain page, looked formula said, ""OK, guru says happen now."" And, presto!<br /><br />Directors Bobby Peter Farrelly don't help film any. concept introduce story characters (they hand V.O. narration protagonist, another guy sits behind Ben Fenway Park). Thanks extremely clunky writing, watch Barrymore Fallon stumble unfunny initial meetings.<br /><br />Barrymore cute adorable better most. She's good Goldie Hawn heyday. even cuteness can't save extraordinarily awful film. tries hard wring energy humor story. 30 minutes film, Lindsey tells Ben, ""You're funny."" explanation remark script. Fallon's Ben never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon neither witty funny; comedy, overacts.<br /><br />Fallon never good ""Saturday Night Live."" quite possibly least funny person show. Remember lame sketch radio DJ voices? reason ""Weekend Update"" worked occasionally Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows thing two comedy.<br /><br />Actors think they're funny behave way rarely, ever, actually funny. That's true Fallon. thinks he's hysterically funny barely raises chuckle. stuttering, unsure-of-himself shtick didn't work small screen; it's lousier big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately Fallon, role picture also requires dramatic moments. thought comedy bad, wait till get load dramatic stuff. Two scenes particular - first park, second front Ben's school - painful watch. scenes require actor smidgen dramatic ability, Fallon neither knowledge ability make work. range emotions doesn't even run gamut B.<br /><br />Ben personality depth. Often, comes across oaf. lovable one that. boggles mind Lindsey would find attractive him. Compare Fallon's performance Firth's British version, you'll understand terribly flat, unfunny forced Fallon's Ben wrong role. Watching Fallon ""Fever Pitch"" makes one long dramatic depth comedic nuance Ashton Kutcher!<br /><br />Just ""High Fidelity"" did, Americanized ""Fever Pitch"" could've worked brilliantly. needed better writers, competent directors and, definitely, stronger, funnier, smarter leading man. huge favor: Avoid rotten film; rent 1997 British version read Hornby's book, instead.",0

Bakshi's aims higher: throwing grotesque exaggerated images black people Italians/mafioso, homosexuals, Jews, overall New York-types urban quarters Manhattan 70s, isn't make anything realistic. normal looking creation looking drawn ""real"" is, fact, naked woman painted red, white blue.<br /><br />In mocking stereotypes conventions horrible forms racism (i.e. ""tar-rabbit, baby"" joke, yes joke, plus black-face), we're looking abstraction grand degree. best all, Bakshi doesn't take seriously, unlike Spike Lee film like Bamboozled, delivering message. why, part, Coonskin hilarious piece work, images things done sudden twists and, course, scenes awkward behavior (I loved scene three animated characters talked real-life white couple tux dress looking ""colorful"" like), much laugh at.

Henry walks dumb girls say: ""He's coming towards us!"" (Thanks info, dumb broads, see that! don't think wants harm!) Marcy sprays eyes, making Henry yelp! ""hero"" Paul touches Henry's arm burning log campfire, recklessly left burning INSIDE cabin! (Where wisdom gone? guess cannabis started take toll!:-) Henry turns Human Torch runs away, screaming.<br /><br />The following day, Bert Jeff head mechanic. Marcy decides ""go help"" herself, woods, Paul stays behind Karen...Doesn't sound idiotic?

Conroy insisted Victoria raised atrocious 'Kensington system', rules designed prevent future Queen contact children growing up.

Strong-willed Victoria would none it, refused go along Conroy's mother's nefarious plans. Duchess disliked King William regarded philanderer brought disrespect Monarchy; King felt Duchess disrespected wife. result, Duchess attempted limit Victoria's contact King. over-the-top scene seemed actually occurred history, King berated Duchess birthday banquet, stating goal survive Victoria reached 18th birthday mother would become regent.<br /><br />King William kept word died short time Victoria became eligible accede throne. Victoria took revenge mother support Conroy, blamed making childhood miserable. banished secluded apartment Buckingham Palace number years Victoria little contact mother.<br /><br />'The Young Victoria' conveys excitement pomp circumstance surrounding Victoria's coronation Queen. good part film deals Victoria's relationship Lord Melbourne, Whig Party Prime Minister unfortunately depicted film much younger actually was. beginning Melbourne gains young Queen's trust become good friends. early years reign, sees Melbourne progressive, later loses respect somewhat he's revealed typical politician, hiding contempt masses he's supposed championing. reality, Melbourne father figure Victoria, film hints sexual tension Prime Minister Prince Albert, though romantic rivals.<br /><br />The plot thickens Melbourne forced Queen must commission Sir Robert Peel, conservative Tory party, new Prime Minister. film chronicles events 'The Bedchamber Crisis' Peel resigned Victoria refused replace Bedchamber ladies wives Tory politicians. film leaves another scandal involved Lady Hastings, one Duchess's ladies-in-waiting accused affair John Conroy becoming pregnant him. hatred Conroy, Victoria contributed nasty rumors spread Hastings' alleged pregnancy. turned out, Hastings appeared pregnantÂ?what actually abdominal tumor. Victoria's inexperience shows Bedchamber Crisis film's scenarists ignore unsavory aspects character evidenced Hastings Affair.<br /><br />The rest 'The Young Victoria' deals -- course -- romance Queen Prince Albert. Victoria kept Albert waiting, film makes clear, since wanted acclimate duties new Sovereign. spent good deal time corresponding one another Albert returned England gave Victoria support trying times Bedchamber Crisis.<br /><br />I find good number parallels Prince Albert Prince Philip, current Queen's husband.

Albert's struggle PhilipÂ?as husbands Monarchs, find something do.

End.<br /><br />It's brainless somehow ends lot fun, despite fairly downbeat ending. Supposedly, widescreen DVD release planned. special movie.",1

"finished watching movie. wasn't ridiculously bad, I'm really disappointed it. I'm really sure someone would make movie like this. marginally entertaining, feel like people making lot disagreements making. Monday, writer charge; Tuesday, director; Wednesday, guy gets coffee; etc. almost seems like really wanted make couple different movies, time money make one.<br /><br />Someone else commented acting really good, I'd disagree. again, actors able keep straight face filming, perhaps they're better actors give credit for.<br /><br />The back DVD gives impression movie would mystery... something along lines historical Law Order National Treasure. starts like that, then, nowhere takes turn towards bad episode Twilight Zone, or... show wasn't good... bad episode Outer Limits.<br /><br />My main complaint movie played out. There's evil guy spiked white hair. There's love interest, who, first appears, wind actually blows hair. Seriously. realize it's Christian movie, end also pretty easy spot.<br /><br />The cinematography poorly done, especially opening scenes - way put best foot forward. wasn't atrocious movie, occasional ridiculously bad shot old lady, praying, arms dark room lightening striking - sort thing makes little bit embarrassed watching movie.",0

Think opening Joe crossing street diner, camera pans behind woman & child sitting bench foreground, framing street scene. <br /><br />The story itself, & characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. touching drawn closely human drama people us would likely spurn. again, Joe & Ratso could us.
