"Soulless milking cash cow franchise. Generic superhero flick. CGI showcase. Gavin Hood's ""A Series Improbable Events."" Combinatoric iteration mutant fight scenes strung together inane exposition justifying formation/dissolution arbitrary alliances. I'm expecting Shakespeare clichГ© per minute meter charts: Primal scream looking skyward kneeling murdered girlfriend. Renegade military commander. Predictable double crosses. Revenge sought slain lover. Erased memories. Evil character discovering morality last minute. Misguided failures execute nemeses defeating melee. Lover really dead. Lover actually acting spy hero's arch-nemesis. Girlfriend/spy actually falls protagonist. Good people work antagonist order save kidnapped family members. Evil mastermind fails honor promises reluctant employees. Kindly old couple care weary hero get murdered troubles. Certain deaths averted third parties arrive scene coup de grace. Hero reluctantly joining secret government agency. Abandonment elite squad protest slaughter innocents. Scientists unable control indestructible killing machine creation. Outdated lovable government 'secret weapon' kills better designed heartless successor. Hero strolls away wreck casually lights trail gasoline behind him. everyone given up, flatlined heart monitor picks pulse. Evil mastermind explains plans hero longer sees threat. Hero refuses kill defeated foe he's ""better that"". Transparent comic relief character makes hilarious understatements offbeat comments. Cheerful psychopath revels random murderous rampages. Nigh indestructible Goliaths hurl one another series walls physical traumas would kill mere mortal. Man dispatches dozens gun wielding enemies nothing skillful swordplay. Common sense laws physics, biology chemistry temporarily abandoned.

Basically, bozos comparing so-called comic talents brilliant Jim Abrahams Zucker Brothers. Come on, I've seen Pauly Shore movies 10 times funnier ""The Underground Comedy Movie."" Here's sample comedy curious seeing movie: One sketch involves superhero dressed like penis named D**kman. whole joke defeats enemies squirting semen. That's it. That's whole joke. Wow. enough make Carrot Top roll eyes. Another sketch involves man sex dead person porn movie. another sketch, there's bag lady beauty contest, we're exposed horrible sights bikini-clad middle-aged women beer guts stretch marks. Plus, making fun homeless sad funny. It's step away mocking mentally handicapped. whole movie supposed satire. think filmmakers forgot key element satire...is TRUTH!!! anybody actually enjoyed crap, explain truthful gags! sketches might've sounded funny paper, anybody who's taken screen writing classes knows sight gag sounds funny paper, probably won't funny screen. tell someone big, black, muscular gay virgin, who's saving right man, would probably laugh. watching premise played screen 10 minutes complete drag. hate whenever people criticize low-brow comedy like funny, they're regarded stuck-up squares. saw ""White Chicks"" recently. That's another low-brow, politically incorrect comedy, laughed head off. offensive thing ""The Underground Comedy Movie"" it's funny! writers directors don't understand merely filthy tasteless doesn't work. more! think famous scene ""There's Something Mary"" (ironically, enough bozo filmmakers put Farrellys special thanks list). joke semen wasn't funny involved bodily fluids. buildup. Ben Stiller masturbating bathroom make sure didn't go date ""loaded gun."" looked around see semen went released. knock door, answer it. date, Mary, door that's it's revealed semen hanging Ben's ear. movie, multiple gags involving characters squirting loads semen people, buildup whatsoever.

Let's face it, nowadays it's hip laugh anything politically incorrect. know comedy subjective...but movie shouldn't funny anybody, except maybe filmmakers themselves. side note, movie made Michael Clarke Duncan's fame movies like ""Armageddon"" ""The Green Mile."" can't reason actor caliber would volunteer part amateurish freak show. others cast either non-actors, has-been actors B-movie stars. Karen Black made good impression ""Five Easy Pieces,"" don't think she's done anything value ever since. Slash probably drugged film. Gina Lee Nolin nothing without ""Baywatch.""

"It's always difficult put stamp film 'the best,' whether time, certain genre, you, believe strong argument could made fact, Laputa greatest animated film ever made. mind masterwork Hayao Miyazaki, talented Japan's animated directors, best captures strengths director, storyteller, designer, well encapsulating favorite underlying themes. version I'm reviewing 2003 American dub (I know, sacrilege hard-core anime fan watch native language); least one English language dub there, VHS (I idea source), version single best dub ever encountered film. thought better concentrate version people actually find.<br /><br />Laputa tells story boy named Pazu (voiced James Van Der Beek here), who's growing mining town one day young girl named Sheeta (Anna Paquin) literally drops sky. seems pursued sinister government agent, Colonel Muska (Mark Hamill), interested magical crystal hangs around neck. keep things lively, there's also wickedly funny pirate gang crystal, led aging still boisterous Dola (Cloris Leachman). plot revolves around crystal's ability reveal location fabled flying city Laputa, potential treasure trove scientific knowledge hidden treasure. It's much keeping fairy-tale setting, Miyazaki knows exactly far take story, plot peppered 'gosh-wow' moments threaded customary morality warnings abusing power nature.<br /><br />The design work Laputa, nearly twenty years later, still revolutionary. Flying machines sorts abound, utterly impossible meticulously designed instantly accept without blinking. world set somewhere around start twentieth century, telegraphs ancient motorcars alongside wonderful impossible flying machines. city sheer brilliance execution; Laputa Garden Eden Fire Heaven itself, juxtaposition lies appeal, power, danger.<br /><br />Besides thoughtfully designed beautifully rendered film, Laputa blessed wonderful sense cinematography. sweeping flying shots high speed chases tiny one-man flyers ships submerging clouds water, Laputa displays scope films В? even magic CGI В? daydream about. Though see small fraction world, simple elegance extends beyond borders frame trouble believing it. film also contains one favorite, exciting, action sequences ever: guardian robot fell Earth accidentally reactivated wreaks havoc fortress kept in, trying protect Sheeta (who one woke up). Meanwhile, Pazu pirates swoop little flying machines snatch her, literally, jaws destruction. horrific sight robot incinerating countryside exhilarating last-second rescue, entire sequence masterpiece timing camera angles knowing exactly far take audience.<br /><br />It helps Laputa amazing score. Composer Joe Hisaishi captures wondrous beauty world, dewy innocence, exciting action, creepy otherworldliness flying city bizarre robot guardians. Though re-recorded DVD release (which IMO improvement original score), adding pieces there, score matches visuals perfectly, rare total union sound vision.<br /><br />This isn't bad dub. I'm inordinately fond older English dub, one over-explains things tad spots, almost shocked closely voices matched (and matched Japanese pretty well). Dola particular hard get right, Leachman spot fiery old pirate woman (her sons aren't quite good original). Paquin good job Sheeta, Mark Hamill, knew early, talented enough Muska (I liked English dub Muska little more, Hamill's good). Much film rests Pazu's shoulders, Van Der Beek wonderful. Listening made think crew must access English dub, VDB matches closely original Pazu. Although watching dub grounds excommunication among otaku faithful, much love film, don't think you're sacrificing great deal simply watching particular Anglicized version. John Lassiter Pixar introduces front, suspicion he, like many others, simply love film much tried hard ensure high quality.<br /><br />Miyazaki success America recent years Spirited Away Mononoke (one films didn't care for), Laputa still crowning achievement.

"Peter Jacksons version(s) better films overall objective point view. said, favorite screen versions Lord Rings, let explain why. <br /><br />Firstly, acting on-screen characters ordinary uninspiring Jackson's LOTR. whole cast run mill. ""Are claiming silly cartoon characters Ralph Bakshi version better actors real people?"" one could ask. Well, really silly(save Hobbits, later them) certainly pack personality Jackson's party - even much limited dialogue time. superior _voice_ acting Bakshi's LOTR. Take Aragorn example. version voice deep charismatic full authority(Aragorn lord)and seasoned rasp(Aragorn ranger). due John Hurt's brilliant voice acting. Compare Viggo Mortensen's rather high pitched sound soul duel gets quickly uneven: Hurt beats Mortensen hands down. <br /><br />And Gandalf. Probably dominating(and popular) character whole saga. Bakshi version Gandalf(William Squire) real wizard. don't mean shoots bolts fingertips(he not), presence captivating. mystical, powerful switch gentle old man scary person ease. Add looks: Tall, old ancient oak, beard long body, sharp eyes, wizardy hook nose course, classical wizard hat. Perfect Gandalf, like books. Ian McKellen's Gandalf hand, simply boring. looks human, sounds human, acts human wears hat wields sword. Yes sword. Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple bloody orc kills sword(as books). stylish slow motion kills. Gandalf power messed with. must noted, I'm sad say this, great Christopher Lee didn't bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr movie did, even limited screen time lines.<br /><br />Before move completely visual aspects movie, must mentioned voice acting general presenation Orcs also superior Jackson's pretendeous bad guys. Bakshi's orcs taunt enemies(or other) constantly growls, screams nasty language. believable monsters faithful book opinion. finally, Black Riders - Nazgul. ultimate bad guys scary ghosts one - riders wearing black. speak haunting voice, mesmerizes victim. favorite scene film Nazgul chasing Frodo near river. Peter Jackson couldn't anything show riders simply chasing party, Bakshi throws nightmarish dream cool slow motion scenes thundering sky.<br /><br />But much like film Jackson's, latter are, technically, still better. key visuals. know Bakshi LOTR features mixture animated characters(all hobbits main cast) real actors covered paint. don't really problem using real people animation way, don't fit well traditional cartoon figures. especially true humans(Riders Rohan, tavern people etc.) Orcs different matter, since meant look distinctive characters. Orcs, played humans animation mix, look far superior Jacksons version. brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face pointed teeth. <br /><br />Biggest screw films visuals, howerver, Hobbits. prefer almost every character Bakshi version compared Jackson, latter clearly superior Hobbits, fact perfect. Bakshi get irritating rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies. forced spend lot movie time them, warned. Again, voice acting OK too, actors mouths cannot save ""immersion damage"" made little weasels. Well, never really liked halflings anyway. <br /><br />General failures Bakshi script well known. Limited playing time(with limited budget) lot missing scenes. film covers nearly half story, doesn't extensive detail compared Jackson's version. <br /><br />In summary Ralph Bakshi version LOTR superior:<br /><br />-overall atmosphere (it feels like Middle-Earth) -overall voice acting -music (I really dig fantasy score Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One John Hurt's finest roles) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (He's fairy hippie one!)<br /><br />While Jackson version better:<br /><br />-because covers whole story -overall visuals special effects -Gollum/Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits<br /><br />Lord Rings Ralph Bakshi, even it's well known shortcomings, one best animation films ever made captures atmosphere Tolkien's fantasy world well, perfectly.

"comedy drama? begin review asking question film witnessed, Hollywood Shuffle, neither funny rather dramatic. tried hard make point, lack definition (comedy drama), clever themes pointed remarks lost. strong believer much racial profiling happening Hollywood, even today, believe Townsend's directorial debut much stop it. Instead, feel added fuel fire. Townsend's comic timing film disastrous due fact elements supposed making fun of, instead promoting vice versa. parts supposed serious somehow destroyed poor lack funny comedy. Townsend decent concept film, sadly execution ultimately hurt film. watch preview film (which constantly do), immediately get wrong impression going see. preview gives impression intelligent, comic film prides intelligence viewers, actually film could truth.<br /><br />The main problem Hollywood Shuffle story (because lacking elaboration); Townsend's direction. wonderful concept film. Exploit Hollywood exploits race. Decent idea, couldn't execute well? first reason ideas random sporadic. structure film like watching heart attack monitor hospital, literally everywhere without warning map. obvious Townsend quite bit say, short amount time in. So, instead defining characters, developing themes, actually creating smart film, throws together prays works. Sadly, doesn't. Instead smart comedy, hodgepodge many ideas, comedic skits, underused actors film goes decent nearly unwatchable. hurts Townsend brief, attempt funny, interruptions throughout film. battling villain known Jerry Curl parodying Siskel & Ebert, Townsend's attempt poke fun speak message film industry falters. small intermittent skits actually distract central focus film actually destroy internally. Townsend seems trying make joke life Hollywood, actually simply connecting every stereotype clichГ© book. could beautiful satire transforms simply generic humor never quite stands apart rest.<br /><br />So, find laughing humor story, perhaps comfort knowing Wayans brothers around help spice dull story. WRONG! Wayans film, Townsend demonstrates ability even bring worst even entertaining family. Definitely pre-In Living Color moments, see comedy something needed constantly improve upon. Perhaps Townsend's direction, maybe atrocious story, typically funny comedians obviously underused ignored came critics film. thought talent pool Townsend pull Hollywood Shuffle would funny, bright, true stab obvious Hollywood dilemma. Sadly, none above.<br /><br />Finally, would like say workable film. moments (while way far between) smile face, final product didn't settle well me. Townsend funny, film felt like playing himself, instead personal experiences troubles. realize probably speaking truth, never came that. Instead, threaded weak story, supports idiotic flash clips may worked sitcom, surely didn't work film. Even comment directorial debut learning film, would disagree. starting fresh, either tight script defined themes. Townsend neither these, combined inability control actors, failed ball flames.<br /><br />Overall, rather disappointing watch. reminded grade school Spelling Bee finally child's time spell. word tough, first two three letters come out, think going work perfectly, random ""P"" silent ""R"" forces excitement come tumbling down. felt Hollywood Shuffle. first, saw potential, saw theme motive behind picture, fuzzy inexperienced technique first couple scenes, experienced deep fall feeling.

Instead showing us exactly Harilal dealt betrayal went head, director moves along story, thus never letting us witness growing resentment Harilal feels towards father. finally see outburst Harilal, comes looking like he's over-reacting. <br /><br />The point I'm trying make never really get understand exactly Harilal became rebel did. never really understand turned Islam, back Hinduism. thing is, never really understand Harilal all. that's director film busy focusing Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi role freedom struggle, story us already familiar with. put simply, Gandhi Father promises examine strained father-son relationship, doesn't much show us cracks relationship first set in. understand Harilal live burden Gandhi's son, show us burden begin with. Show us incidents early conflict. example, it's enough Gandhi merely says he's opposed Harilal's early marriage, tell us opposition? It's enough Kasturba blames husband way son turned - constantly shuttling schools Gujarat South Africa, making relocate every time Gandhi needed relocate. Words enough, show us incidents shaped character Harilal Gandhi.What's more, instead sticking prickly theme tenuous Gandhi versus Gandhi relationship, film goes many tangents, thus diluting impact central theme. never meant film struggle Independence, yet many occasions that's exactly seems like, director feels almost obligated take us main events leading upto historic moment, even though much relevance film's basic premise - stormy father-son relationship. see problem film it's bad film, it's certainly confused film. happens Harilal's children wife's death? ever relationship them? suddenly vanish one scene see Mahatma Kasturba? None questions answered film that's basically meant relationships Gandhi family. film version immensely popular play directed Feroz Abbas Khan himself, Gandhi Father disappointment, questions asked.Cinematically, struggles translate filmmaker's ambitious intention screen. Practically every single scene film opens closes fade-ins fade-outs, never quite seamlessly leading other. positive side, inherent nobility film, recognise. filmmaker makes every effort deliver balanced narrative, trying hard take sides, never judging either father son, painting neither villain. film do, however, make clear fact Gandhi difficult patriarch whose ideals may shaped nation, evidently alienated family. actors film it's Akshaye Khanna really shines role luck-deprived Harilal Gandhi. It's wonderful performance, it's easy since role covers virtually entire lifespan character. Akshaye brings rare concoction innocence despondency part succeeds making Harilal pitiable figure. watch scene discovers wife's dead, you'll realise much conveys body language alone. Darshan Jariwala, meanwhile, plays Gandhi Senior, adopts caricaturish approach playing Mahatma later years, it's way humanises man early years barrister South Africa actor's best contribution role. abundantly gifted Shefali Shah plays Kasturba, woman who's meant torn father-son conflict, she's unable bring across feeling helplessness it's really much fault fault rickety script.

It's one films tries hard, come oddest possible scenarios get two protagonists together end. fact, charm innate, contained within characters setting plot... highly believable boot. It's easy think love story, beautiful ever told, *could* happen you... feeling don't often get romantic comedies, however sweet heart-warming may be. <br /><br />Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) Clara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) don't auspicious first meetings arrives shop (Matuschek & Co.) he's working past nine years, asking job. clash beginning, mostly cigarette box plays music it's opened--he thinks it's ludicrous idea; makes one big sell gets hired. bickering takes next six months, even (unconsciously, course!) fall love share souls minds letters passed PO Box 237. would pretty thin plotline base entire film on, except SHOP AROUND CORNER expertly fleshed-out brilliant supporting cast made entirely engaging characters, fatherly lonely Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) himself, learns shop really home; Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), Kralik's sidekick friend always skitters room faced possibility asked honest opinion; smarmy pimp-du-jour Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) ultimately gets comeuppance gloriously righteous Kralik; ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona (William Tracy) wants nothing promoted position clerk Matuschek & Co. unpretentious love story 'Dear Friends' played little shop Budapest, Hungary, Kralik's unceremonious dismissal subsequent promotion shop manager help two lovebirds-to-be along. It's nice everyone gets story film; supporting characters well-developed, Matuschek's journey life almost touching one Alfred Clara share. invitation new errand boy Rudy (Charles Smith) Christmas Eve dinner, made whirling, beautiful snow Hungarian winter, makes audience glad alone; come care even characters whose love story isn't film's business tell. <br /><br />Aside love story, must say James Stewart truly one best things film. doesn't play full-fledged Jimmy Stewart persona film (c/f 'Mr Smith Goes Washington' that); fact Alfred Kralik prickly abrupt particularly kind. He's rather brusque man, fact, little hint (until, perhaps, end) aw-shucks down-home boyish charm Stewart would soon come patent. finds Clara corresponding secret, fact, Kralik doesn't 'fess up--he waits see far take charade, especially since quickly realises (given stormy relationship Clara boss underling) loving person knows exchanged letters might equate loving person herself. description Clara fictional Matthias Popkin (what name!) become fiance hilarious extreme, also way proving letters don't reveal man, letters don't reveal her. Stewart plays role perfectly--he keeps face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr. Kralik, often wont do, even (and especially) face. yet one believes, underneath brusqueness professionalism, *could* reveal identity much earnestness sincerity sheer *hope* eventually does. <br /><br />Special mention must given members cast well. Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well first half film, really comes closing-shop scene Christmas Eve, almost gets heart broken Alfred's vivid description mailbox sweetheart. Frank Morgan turns great performance jealous Hugo Matuschek driven nervous breakdown, man rediscover meaning life realises wife 22 years want 'grow old him'. Felix Bressart plays role meek loyal Pirovitch wonderfully (a Lubitsch regular, since appears hilarious Russian ambassador NINOTCHKA)--of particular note scene helps good friend Alfred get Christmas present latter *really* wants... wallet instead ludicrous cigarette box Clara hung on. <br /><br />Ernst Lubitsch really proud film--for example, famously lavish meticulous care given detail creation Matuschek shop well worth effort, right Hungarian names door, wares cash register on. even though Lubitsch chose story set Hungary, setting actually universal: could happen anywhere; could happen you. Therein lies charm simple story, believable characters really *are* people. snow Christmas Eve real well, least real Lubitsch could make (he snow machines brought great expense). desire make everything appear real possible helps make story even believable, gives entire film dreamy realism cannot replicated.

Unexperienced ways females courting, Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe help win Aunt Susie over. Along way, however, Joe finds falling gal thinks belongs best friend. Brooklyn going take betrayal? Joe end Susie, loves too?<br /><br />The first second times saw ANCHORS AWEIGH, also saw time TOWN, Kelly/Sinatra collaboration 1949. times felt ANCHORS AWEIGH better film terms plotting structure--all dances songs fit moment plot, develop characters story rather hamper them. Yet, times came away feeling TOWN better film overall. seen films third time, still stand judgement. Somehow TOWN, film piece entertainment, lighter, gayer, purely simply *happier*. numbers outrageous less integral plot, yet somehow works better dances singing ANCHORS AWEIGH. I'm quite sure is. typical argument latter film over-long: almost two half hours, certainly valid criticism make. certainly felt length first two times saw it! However, it's also film grows you--the see it, shorter feels appreciate technical mastery involved making. yet, something doesn't hang together quite right. feels almost script pored over, *every* single moment Kelly could break dance Sinatra song noted, that's exactly happened. opportunity shoehorn musical number given up... that's probably film's biggest weakness. 16 numbers (give take few), matter big fan Kelly Sinatra, really starts turn one numb while. (Contrast this, example, ten numbers TOWN.) might well feel song, dance, can't taken film without leaving lacking... that's true. that's also writers weren't restrained adding first place.<br /><br />All long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good ANCHORS AWEIGH. musical *is* splashy great songs bursting over, like duets Kelly Sinatra ('We Hate Leave', 'I Begged Her' 'If Knew Susie'), singing Sinatra ('What Makes Sunset', 'The Charm You', best all, 'I Fall Love Easily'), without doubt always inventive, always breathtaking dancing Kelly. It's also hard miss cast calibre. Grayson sweet seems improve viewing (her voice becoming stunning rather frightening); Jose Iturbi's role written sympathetically great job it; even Clarence's Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, cute charming... close one could get Betty Garrett without Garrett herself! Sinatra adorable blue eyes curls his, plays innocent boy-man wonderfully (a role reprises TOWN). singing is, usual, simply faultless enunciation timing phrasing. solo numbers might seem drag little, you've got voice century, showcasing probably good reason slow rest film!<br /><br />Gene Kelly's sheer genius film worthy paragraph. Third billing behind Sinatra Grayson respectively, ANCHORS AWEIGH really Kelly's film. Joe Brady believable, real character--he's tough outside, glib willing lie necessary win gal, he's actually biggest softy inside. Kelly makes charming rather cloying, also gives Joe real edge see scene Joe chases Brooklyn around room genuinely murderous look face breakfast tray hands. *dancing*--again, film suffers 'too much good thing spoils effect' syndrome, Sinatra's singing. again, it's Gene Kelly softshoe, tapping across screen sailor's outfit dressed bandit chief... might well err side overdoing it! Kelly's dances breathtaking, pared-down simplicity tap number Sinatra 'I Begged Her', 'Mexican Hat Dance' sweet wide-eyed little girl, lavish Spanish-influenced dance 'La Cumparsita'. course, classic image left audiences' minds time would Kelly red, white blue sailor suit, dancing Jerry Mouse 'Tom & Jerry' fame. well-deserved golden film memory, sure--it's often one say you're impressed special effects film made 1945, given saturation CGI contemporary film market. Gene Jerry still look great, Kelly always hitting spots looking exactly needs look. *would* turn people could really keep Gene Kelly would Kelly (in COVER GIRL) cartoon animation. <br /><br />It's doubtless first daring, inventive Kelly dance Jerry reserved place ANCHORS AWEIGH film history hearts classic film buffs. it's also notable first three Kelly/Sinatra film collaborations, though rather drawn-out, still great couple hours entertainment.

It's almost Kubrick banking people's love novel order make film frightening. way, it's certainly one interesting book adaptations ever made, well one greatest horror films.<br /><br />What makes film terrifying jump scares, blood gore, various ghosts pop time time. It's destruction Jack Torrence. people complained casting Nicholson role, saying it's obvious he's going go crazy film, given past roles appearance. disagree. know he's going go crazy В? since us read book В? Jack's appearance furthers notion. it's way acts beginning makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. engages inane small talk hotel managers even family. wife son irritating his, it's small wonder manages so. gets Overlook, changes. becomes irritable, angry, edge. scene always shocks Wendy interrupts typing, utterly loses it, telling ""leave f*** alone"". first f-bomb dropped film, it's shock system. on, bets off.<br /><br />Another thing love multiple interpretations present film. We're never really sure we're seeing actually happening. Many critics noted whenever Jack talks ghost, there's mirror present, showing may well talking himself. characters? Wendy never sees anything film's climax, given tour hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, well aware something wrong, Danny connects place almost immediately. psychic powers question В? else would Hallorann know come hotel? В? ever see ghosts parents witness? It's easy claim Jack merely loses it, trapped hotel family, Wendy later well В? seeing husband attempt kill axe В? Danny? appears body taken Tony, know sure? None characters reliable witnesses. Hallorann probably would be, warns dangers 237, he's killed soon arrives Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves playing assumptions fans novel). final shot. ever enigmatic ending cinema? Jack really before? body merely 'absorbed' hotel? talking acting film, discussion begins ends Jack Nicholson. Shelley Duvall gives one annoying performances cinematic history В? probably purpose, give Jack's character reason snap В? Danny Lloyd better, Jack powerhouse. Part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying appealing. better worse, he's character identify with, annoying kid nagging wife. want hotel season, able whatever want. cares it's haunted? course, technical aspects terrific. Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, bizarre imagery contribute horror. use colour, mirrors, long hallways, every motif heightens this. don't even get started score. don't know film would half scary without haunting, electronic tune. strangeness perfectly reflects hotel, mood, entire film itself.<br /><br />I know King doesn't like film, King's input cinema nothing brag about. great novel writer may be, screenplays terrible, attempt directing better left unnoticed. faithful book adaptation, doesn't need be, really shouldn't. Part horror film viewer doesn't book fall back on; there's reassuring source material. Kubrick masterfully alters narrative terrify audience even more. that, one innovative films genre. it's got everything else top that.",

Boss posturing, convincingly deluded figure, unable realise small-fry nature kingdom... It's great role, yet Richardson makes lot it.<br /><br />Everytown presumably meant England, least English town fairly representative England. Interesting complete avoidance religious side things; 'things come' seem revolve around conflict warlike barbarism faith science seems little ultimate goal, go on. belated attempt raise arguments tensions last section, concerning personal 'life', yet one left quite unsatisfied. film hasn't got much interest subtle complexities; goes barnstorming spectacle unsubtle, blunt moralism, every time.

Lasting nearly 30 years, mind!? nuclear bomb - ""super gun"" contraption - 2036... technocratic socialist ""we don't believe independent nation states""-type government, Britain, 1970... Hmmm, sadly nowhere near one, chaps! ;-) real politics gone shame; surfaces laudable anti-war sentiment. Generally, assumed dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist, Boss, all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - *be deal*, implications broached... must remember 1936, knowledge Nazism Communism would turn - even turning - lack consideration seems meek beside scope filmmakers' vision matters.<br /><br />Much earlier stuff - could - cut opinion; briefest stuff '1940' would necessary, yet segment tends get rather ponderous, ages get Richardson-Massey parts. would liked seen done Margareta Scott; trifle sceptical, cutting flashing-eyed Mediterranean figure negligible purpose. character explored, frankly explained exploited, except one scene shall spoil, relationship Boss isn't explored; 1930s, thing widespread institutional censorship back then.

First foremost, writers capture 'kid dialogue' better children's film I've ever seen. prime example comes directly boys' principal accidentally eats worm stuck egg omelet. boys lame, over-exaggerated impression principal lecturing them, makes realistic since little kids think (mistakenly) great mocking expressions adult tormentors. one boys asks, ""Why say, 'alley oop'?"" Another boy responds, ""Maybe he's crazy!"" entire group laughs uproariously. overly witty rejoinder, exactly kind thing young kid would come spot exactly type remark kids age would find hilarious. confirm it, kid brother laughed right cue spoken on-screen; could practically hear voice spouting exact lines placed similar situation.<br /><br />Another reason movie works writers manage work issues like bullying, sibling relationships, new kid school, peer pressure/conformity without making seem though subplots school special. example, bully (Joe) isn't stereotypical; he's definitely bad pure evil, enough home-life revealed audience feels sympathy understands bullying origins. There's also ""cue dramatic music"" moment Billy ('Worm Boy') realizes complete tool he's younger brother Woody, yet, end movie, type minor transformation made.

"""anthology"" horror film. It's made 4 short stories taken fiction Robert Bloch (who wrote Weird Tales personal friends H.P.

I've seen Amicus anthology films one really worth time Freddie Francis' ""Tales Crypt."" anthology style works well producers, means hire bunch ""big name"" actors, employ one week shooting so, bring next big name. essentially pay 6 weeks movie star salary get 5 6 different names marquee. that's unfortunate audience, audience would like see scenes Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Ingrid Pitt actually acting together. Instead they're stuck vignettes themselves. let's take one time, briefly.<br /><br />The first story Denholm Elliot, really admirable job trying bring dignity silly role writer terrorized character. Unfortunately actor plays Dominic, source horror, Tom Adams, looks silly ruins possible horror. There's hilarious stuff want laugh though, like scene Dominic kills Elliot's psychiatrist. It's patented scene killer creeps behind victim nobody watching, whole audience supposed shout ""LOOK BEHIND YOU!"" second story one Peter Cushing. God love man much. bad many films, like one, pretty much stink. story he's supposed pining away long-lost love, sees likeness wax museum. It's completely predictable story goes nowhere.<br /><br />Then bit Christopher Lee, plays father little kid turns witch. bit could fun played laughs. instead we're supposed horrified Lee slaps child surprised turns evil. actress, Chloe Franks, pretty good type ""Bad Seed"" role though.<br /><br />The last story kind amusing... Ingrid Pitt plays actress Jon Pertwee plays actor accidentally buys vampire cape turns real vampire.

"Godard said way criticize movie make one, probably strongest kind could made Ralph Bakshi's take Tolkien's magnum opus Lord Rings, actually made Peter Jackson. recent trilogy, me, aren't even total masterpieces, given enough room book breath post-modern techniques crossed classical storytelling make good, sweeping entertainments. <br /><br />But one read books, end looking upon two versions, live-action (albeit partly animated big visual effects way) animated (albeit partly done actual live action framework) relation basic story, even complete faithfulness books. Bakshi's version, it's almost fair way, see really complete vision, Jackson really (probably final cut). Robbed Return King's big climactic rush story, two parts becoming rushed, ended liking within limitations, though limitations make disappointing.<br /><br />What's interesting too, seeing Jackson films first- also slightly regret might've reacted differently younger prior five years ago- basic elements story never get messed with. Everything really needed tell Fellowship Ring story actually pretty much intact, anything probably even gigantic epic Tolkien's book given clarity section. actors playing parts hobbits heroes, less adequate parts, parts standing (John Hurt Aragorn William Squire Gandalf). <br /><br />The lack extra characterization end making things seem little face-value who've even seen films read books can't put context. level interest always characters, there's old-fashioned sensibility amid large aura more. garden variety Disney adaptation- warts all, Bakshi film, underground animation roots colliding mythical world Middle Earth.<br /><br />And Bakshi animation team bring film one ends giving screen, abbreviated form, hit miss appeal. Along totally complete film, stories, form film experiment, see something entirely rotoscoped. results end bringing seems retro, time course something rough, crazy inspiration part filmmakers. Might better traditional drawn animation? parts, yeah; become little noticeable, also case Bakshi's American Pop, main characters move ways little shaky, like kind comic-book form done different way. Still, there's much admired done. <br /><br />The orcs, example, found really amazing they're surreal surroundings. They're maybe best part combination animation top live-action, especially parts isn't battle footage (that's really real hit-or-miss section, isn't continuity good bad rotoscoping), chiaroscuro comes big shapes top horseback. It's creepy good way. backgrounds, also rough sometimes sketchy, beautiful mixtures blasts colors together. It's almost something art-film buffs much ring-nuts.<br /><br />So, would recommend animated take Lord Rings? don't know, tell truth. It's certainly good notch Tolkien animated film I've seen, Hobbit (and I've yet see animated ROTK), real artistry going on. There's also stilted dialog, all-too-rushed Two Towers segment intriguing character Gollum reduced maybe two scenes all. seeing something fragmented like ends reinforcing completeness recent films. <br /><br />If you're fan books contemplating checking out, would say it's worth chance, even it's one chances watch forty minutes decide whether stop not. fitting Bakshi's films I've seen it's impressive ambitious spotty achievement, Lynch's Dune it's bound draw dark, mordor-like line sand hate passionately don't. don't.",

"""Flavia, la monaca muslmana"" aka. ""Flavia Heretic"" 1974 truly disturbing uncompromising piece Italian Exploitation cinema that, certain extent, follows somewhat feminist premise (though level sleaze brutality would probably disgust majority feminists). Set mostly convent, nun eponymous central protagonist (great performance wonderful Florinda Bolkan), ""Flavia Heretic"" may referred 'Nunsploitation' film. However, film differs quite drastically typical Nunsploitation flicks time, doesn't much focus nunsploitation elements lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc. Personally, saw similarities Hexploitation flicks time, ""Mark Devil"", (even though one doesn't treat topic witch-hunts), focus brutal execution Christian fundamentalism middle ages early modern period.<br /><br />Italy around 1600: witnessing despotic father behead wounded Muslim soldier, young Flavia forced become nun convent. father condemns fellow nun torturous death small misdemeanor years later, Falvia's disgust male violence women turns hatred despotic church, joins band Arabic scavengers...<br /><br />One thing sure, ""Flavia Heretic"" faint-hearted, neither want happy endings. Director Gianfranco Mingozzi obviously tried make film realistic disturbing possible, especially nasty scenes. many torture- execution-scenes extremely disturbing, skinnings, spikings gruesome scenes explicit detail, shocking scene probably torture young nun quite beginning film. violence never superfluous, however. all, gruesome methods actually reality time film set in. film well-made, realistic costumes, fantastic settings elegant cinematography great score Nicola Piovani. stunningly beautiful great Florinda Bolkan proved talent many great Italian cult-productions (including Lucio Fulci's Giallo-masterpiece ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" 1972). delivers another great, charismatic performance here, couldn't imagine another actress fitting well role does. film minor inconsistencies (E.g. rigid church let bizarre cult-followers convents first place). However, overall amazing realistic film is. ""Flavia Heretic"" definitely missed fellow fans Italian Exploitation Cinema. great Exploitation flick overall, though definitely deeply depressing one therefore watched right mood. Highly recommended fans disturbing exploitation cinema. 7.5/10",

"filming 80's horror movie called 'Hot Blooded', director brutally murdered leading lady scarred survives attack manages kill murderer. this, production abandoned stock reels left gather dust. group filmmakers decide pick film left even though they're warned people keep away film, last person interested flick turned dead cinema watching film. it's labelled cursed production. taking warnings seriously crew goes ahead production get original star movie return Hollywood reprise role, daughter mother. murders start occurring cast crew getting butchered unknown figure dressed film's killer.<br /><br />Look 'Scream' started! Hey, enjoy films, mostly everything else followed afterwards annoying pointless excuses. stage sub-genre came back vengeance, wasn't much good thing mostly unsuccessful unoriginal attempts, followed derivative pattern Scream franchise. 'Cut' independent Australian take textbook slasher genre purely shonky garbage lacks basically everything shamelessly knocks every slasher flick. know what, found cheesy delight. Yeah, It's gawd awful highly forgettable, it's bit ala good cheap fun lasted. Although hate originally came across it, second time around knew getting worked better it. like helping nice slice cheesecake again, time wasn't sweet.<br /><br />The film came around time 'Scream 3' 'Urban Legends: Final Cut' did, three follow structure using movie within movie. 'Scream 3' obviously strongest three, would actually watch trash Urban Legends: Final Cut. Though, seem throwback 80's slashers one Scream's bastard offspring. Pretty much film given b-grade treatment shows script performances. dialog truly unimaginative hardly comes surprises suspense. While, performances pure mockery Molly Ringwald takes crown it. plays wash-up actress returning finish cursed flick good fun laughably ridiculous send-up performance. provides bite nails perfectly. rest mostly recognizable Australian TV stars (that's you're Australian) ravishing Jessica Napier leading cast likes Stephen Curry Frank Roberts. Also pop singer (and supposed actress) Kylie Minogue makes cameo appearance opening hacked up! Nice. teens mostly followed formula horny dim-witted kids nothing better killed. Sometimes feels like waiting queue, real substance there.<br /><br />The plot starts rather interestingly, heads mystery phase red herrings pop up, makes sudden u-turn becomes somewhat satire horror genre. Simply it's rather choppy comes explanation madness kind left thinkingВ oh my. tries twist back onto clever manner, sadly falls along way. don't love opening ending. Also sports pop culture references self referential, tongue-in-cheek approach. Predictability makes way rather early jokes become over-stated times, knows poking fun quite bit. atmosphere looses bit edge humour taking away bleakness, still isolated grand old mansion filming neat touches added 'some' spookiness. cinema scene done rather nicely too.<br /><br />Now, know want gore nudity watching type flick, sadly there's nudity found gore pretty standard, lacking it's decent low-budget flick. one two creative deaths, rest systematic. killer wasn't bad spoke kind hurt thought, well smart-ass attitude didn't sit well me. Another notes production dire ranged cut-away editing, out-of-place soundtrack Kimble Rendall's direction lacked execution pretty careless, contributing factors pull together add sort sheer entertainment badness.<br /><br />The imagination matches budget that's sure, heck lousy slasher wasn't trying anything else.
